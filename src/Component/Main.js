                In most cultures women are seen to play a very vital roles in taking <br />
                care of the family and also building up morals, values etc to the next
                generation (children). <br />
                that means more time is required for them to be  around the young ones. <br />
                having career in tech makes it possible for one
                to do that in the sense one can work from home and do other things. <br />

                but in our morden time no matter the career one is into , it is good to
                be knowledgeable in Tech .
